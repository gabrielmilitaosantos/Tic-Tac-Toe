# Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, built using React. 
It was developed as part of a learning exercise from the Academind course, where we explored 
key concepts such as state management, destructuring, and the React component lifecycle.

## Features

* React Functional Components: The project is structured around reusable and modular functional components.
* State Management: Each square in the Tic Tac Toe grid is managed with local state, and the game logic is handled with React's useState hook.
* Destructuring: Extensive use of destructuring for cleaner code and easier manipulation of props and state.
* Conditional Rendering: Game status and messages are updated dynamically based on the state of the game.
* Reusable Components: The board and squares are separated into components, enhancing reusability and clarity.

## Technologies Used

* React: A Javascript library for building user interfaces.
* JavaScript (ES6+): Used for modern language features, including destructuring, arrow functions, and template literals.
* CSS: Basic styling for the game interface.
